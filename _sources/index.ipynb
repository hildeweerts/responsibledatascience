    "With the advent of large-scale data collection, the toolkit of a data scientist has proven to be a powerful way to make products and processes faster, cheaper, and better. Many data science applications make use of {term}`machine learning` algorithms: algorithms that build mathematical models by `learning' from data. Nowadays, machine learning models are integrated in many computer systems: from music recommendations to automated fraud detection, facial recognition systems, and personalized medicine assistants. These systems can provide benefits, but are not without risks.\n",

    "A responsible data scientist understands how machine learning models might be harmful and how the risks can be mitigated. This online book provides a practical introduction to the nascent field of responsible data science, structured around three themes.\n",
